                Founded in 1963, The Saviola Group has become a global leader in the chipboard manufacturing industry.
                In 1981, Saviola revolutionized the world of decorative boards by developing melamine-faced panels,
                providing high-quality substitutes for traditional wood and stone surfaces. This innovation made Saviola
                a pivotal force in the furniture industry, delivering aesthetically pleasing and functional decorative
                solutions.

                Driven by a commitment to environmental sustainability, Saviola took a groundbreaking step in 1997,
                becoming the first to rely entirely on recycled materials for board production. Through large-scale
                recycling programmes, they now recycle 1.2 million tonnes of post-consumer wood annually, transforming
                waste into 100% recycled wood chipboard.

                decorative boards. Explore their collection and see how Saviola brings together stunning design and
