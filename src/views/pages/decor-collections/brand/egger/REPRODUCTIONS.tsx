              One of the few companies that offers a beautiful mix of tree species in various textured surfaces to bring
              the outdoors into your living and working spaces is Egger. Along with the typical oaks and walnuts, this
              collection also includes some uncommon wood species like coco bolo, hickory, acacia and wenge. To enhance
              the natural aesthetic, every wood design has been finished in a variety of brown tones, so there is
              something for everyone.
